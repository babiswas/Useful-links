Stateful Applications
=====================
stateless application->Deployment(Kubernetes Component)
stateful application->statefulset(Kubernetes Component)

kubectl scale statefulset name --replicas=x -n mynamespace

Deployment v/s Statefulset
==========================
Each pod associated with stateful set has ordered identity.

   Service
   -------
|     |      |
|     |      |
p1    p2     p3

In deployment replica pods get random id
In statefiul set the replica pod get ordered id
Sticky identity is maintained for each pod in statefulset

Scaling database applications
=============================

Is there any master slave relation between the replicasets to prevennt inconsistancy?
New replica will clone data from previous pod.

All data will be lost if all pods die.

Remote storage is required.

Each pod has its own service name

       Service dns
       =========
     |    |     |
     p1   p2    p3
     dns1 dns2  dns3

1.Configure cloning and data synchronization
2.Managing and back up
3.Make remote storage available
kubectl exec POD_NAME -it -n namespace /bin/sh
kubectl logs --follow podname  -n namespace>mylog1.txt
cat mylog1.txt|tail -n +30|head -n 10
